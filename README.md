[open]lipc - open-source LIPC
=============================

LIPC seems to be an IPC library based on D-Bus. It links all Kindle components together. Via this
library one is able to expose application properties/settings, listen for or emit events, and many
more (potentially). It is considered to be one of the core components of the Kindle device.

This project was inspired by the work of Bartek Fabiszewski, who has also reverse-engineered this
library. His [work](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/openlipc) was a starting point for my further
investigations.
